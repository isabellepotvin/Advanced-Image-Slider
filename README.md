# Advanced-Image-Slider

This is a web based image slider. I built this image slider with the goal of practing/developing my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. It has multiple features and is visually appealing.

## Features
- Left and right arrows to change images
- Progress circles that:
  - Indicate the number of images 
  - Which image is currently being displayed
  - Switches to a specific image when clicked
- Image title, description and link/button specific to each image

## Style
- The left and right arrows are only visible when the mouse is hovered over image slider
- A CSS animation was added to the arrows for a slide-in/slide-out effect 
- A CSS animation was implemented for a smooth cross-fade transition between images
